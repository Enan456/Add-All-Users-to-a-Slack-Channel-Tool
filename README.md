Add All Users to a Slack Channel Tool
Follow the steps here to get an export: https://slack.com/help/articles/201658943-Export-your-workspace-data

Find the users.json file and move it in to this folder
That's all! run the script, open the new_list.csv file and copy all and paste.

Note: I did miss 25/148 members last time I ran this but will update if i find a fix
